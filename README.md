## Introduction:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our research paper titled "**Deep Feature Extraction from EEG Signals Using Xception Model for Emotion Classification.**" In this study, we delve into the exciting realm of emotion recognition through electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Our research explores the immense potential of leveraging cutting-edge deep neural network architectures to elevate the accuracy and robustness of emotion classification from EEG signals.

## Key Highlights:
- Rigorous experimentation: We meticulously assess the classification performance of various models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, LogitBoost, AdaBoost M1, and more.
- Superior accuracy: Our results demonstrate remarkable accuracy, surpassing existing benchmarks in EEG-based emotion recognition.
Xception's prowess: The study emphasizes the potency of the Xception architecture, trained on an extensive dataset, as an effective feature extractor for EEG data.
- Implications and future directions: We discuss the implications of our findings and outline potential avenues for further research, exploring diverse neural network architectures and algorithmic enhancements.

## GitHub Repository Contents:
- **Code Implementation:** The "_EEG_Spectrograms.ipynb_" notebook is responsible for generating the spectrograms. The "_Xception_feature_extractor.ipynb_" extracts and preserves features derived from the Xception model, while the "_wavelet_feature_extractor.ipynb_" file saves the wavelet features. You can find the training and testing procedures for the Random Forest model in the "_randomforest.ipynb_" file. In contrast, the training and testing for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model are documented in the "_svm.ipynb_" file. 
- **Datasets:** Access the [extended dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_hkPVsYhyyWby6rzDD5yLTS-e5_tk8Zv/view?usp=sharing) used in our study, enabling you to replicate our experiments and validate our results.
